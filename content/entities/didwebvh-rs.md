# didwebvh-rs

*Repo: [github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-rs](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-rs)*

A Rust library providing the reference implementation of the [[did-webvh|did:webvh]] DID method, conforming to the v1.0 specification from the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF). Currently at version 0.5.2.

## What It Provides

The full DID lifecycle for did:webvh:
- **Creation** — generate new DIDs with SCIDs and initial history entries
- **Resolution** — fetch and validate DID documents with full history verification
- **Update** — append new entries to the verifiable history log
- **Key rotation** — rotate keys with pre-rotation support
- **Deactivation** — properly deactivate a DID
- **Domain migration** — move a DID to a new domain while preserving identity
- **Witness management** — add, remove, and validate witness proofs
- **did:web export** — generate did:web-compatible documents

## Architecture

Key design features:
- **Pluggable signing** — a `Signer` trait lets callers provide their own signing backend (HSM, KMS, cloud) so private keys never enter the library
- **WASM-friendly** — resolution-only builds work in WebAssembly environments
- **Feature flags** — TLS backend selection (`rustls`, `native-tls`), optional `ssi` crate integration, CLI flows
- **Embeddable CLI** — interactive terminal flows for third-party applications to integrate did:webvh operations

## Role in the Ecosystem

This is a foundational building block. The [[affinidi-tdk|Affinidi TDK]] uses it for DID resolution, the [[affinidi-webvh-service]] builds hosting infrastructure on top of it, and the [[verifiable-trust-agent|VTA]] uses it for DID management. Any component that creates, resolves, or verifies a did:webvh identifier depends on this library.

## Recent Development

The repository has been quiet since v0.5.2; tracks the DIF didwebvh 1.0 spec closely.

### v0.5.2 — 2026-04-29

- Implicit service ID spec compliance fix
- PQC example improvements

### v0.5.1 — 2026-04-29

- didwebvh 1.0 spec-compliance patch

### v0.5.0 — 2026-04-18 — major release rollup

- Embeddable interactive CLI flows for third-party apps
- In-memory log verification (`resolve_log()`)
- HTTP response size limits for resolution safety
- `Signer` trait replacing direct `Secret` usage
- Convenience APIs (`update_document()`, `rotate_keys()`, `deactivate()`)
- Cache serialization (`save_state` / `load_state`)
- Wiremock-based tests replacing live network tests
- Criterion benchmarks

### v0.4.2 — 2026-04-14

- Removed yanked core2/multihash transitive dependency
